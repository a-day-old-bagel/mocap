AWESOME REFLECTION/REFRACTION:
  To the effect of glassy/water-droplet-y-looking balls for joints on my
  character(s).
  Also, a glassy-looking floor.
  glass effects can cycle colors on key-press (C)
  
FULL ENVIRONMENT MAPS:
  featuring cube maps that allow for the drawing of a skybox using
  JUST ONE TRIANGLE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
  environment map can cycle between several provided varieties
  ON KEY PRESS (F) ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
  
NOTICE THAT:
  all "glass" effects include specular reflection, optical light effects
  (look at the sun through the glass balls) AAAAND
  reflection effects that increase in intensity as viewing angle becomes
  more oblique JUST LIKE REAL LIFE ! ! ! ! ! ! !
  AAAAAAAAAAAAND
  Refraction effects that deminish with viewing angle obliqueness,
  spoofing the effect of interior reflection and stuff!  stuff!
  
ALSO:
  you can turn the arms and legs (connections, not joints) off with
  keypress (X).  Because they looked kinda ugly to me.  I liked it
  with just the joints more.  But whatever, it's in the assignment.
